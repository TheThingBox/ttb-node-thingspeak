This node allows to send data to [https://thingspeak.com](https://thingspeak.com/)

It comes form the Thingbox ([http://thethingbox.io](http://thethingbox.io)) but it can be used in any Node-RED installation.



Just copy the files into a directory called "nodes" within your .node-red directory and restart Node-RED.
